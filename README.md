# Migration: examining patterns of residential mobility and internal migration in the United States
## Data
I use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from IPUMS program
## Problems:
1. Examine how the "Age" variable is related to the binary decision of whether to stay in the same housing unit or to move to a new housing unit, regardless of the migration distance.
3. Examine how the "Age" variable relates to the decision to move across various geographic boundaries (e.g., stay, move within a state, move between states, etc.).
4. Examine how the "Age" variable relates to the decision of which state to move to. This applies, of course, only to those who make moves between states.

## Methods:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Logistic regression model
3. Multinomial logistic regression models
4. Discrete Choice Models
